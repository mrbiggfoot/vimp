# vimp
This is my vim configuration. Use at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
- [ctags](https://github.com/fdinoff/exuberant-ctags) with protobuf support (just because I work with protobuf a lot)
- [GNU idutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils)
- [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)

## Installation

Add the following line to your .vimrc (assuming vimp is checked out in the home dir):
`source ~/vimp/vimrc`

Start vim and run `:PluginInstall`.

## Notes

Some key bindings may not work as I use iTerm2 with customized keyboard shortcuts.
Just remap them to whatever you want.
